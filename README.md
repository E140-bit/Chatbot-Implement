Overview
This project is designed to create a chatbot capable of answering user queries based on predefined intents and patterns. Using Natural Language Processing (NLP), it recognizes user inputs and provides relevant responses. The chatbot can be extended with machine learning models for intent classification and further enhanced with external frameworks like Flask for web deployment.

Features
Natural Language Understanding (NLU): The chatbot recognizes user queries by tokenizing input and matching it to predefined patterns.
Intent Classification: Utilizes simple pattern matching or advanced machine learning models for accurate intent prediction.
Web Integration: Flask integration enables the chatbot to be deployed as a web service.
Interactive Console: Users can interact with the chatbot via a command-line interface.
Requirements
To run this project, you'll need to install the following libraries:


!pip install nltk tensorflow flask numpy matplotlib
Python Libraries Used:
NLTK: For natural language processing tasks such as tokenization and lemmatization.
TensorFlow: For deep learning-based natural language understanding and training models.
Flask: For creating a web interface for the chatbot.
NumPy: For handling numerical operations and array manipulations.
Matplotlib: For visualizing data or the performance of the chatbot (if necessary).

How to Run
Install Dependencies: Run the following command to install required libraries.


!pip install nltk tensorflow flask numpy matplotlib
Run the Chatbot: Open a terminal and run the Python script:


python app.py
You can then interact with the chatbot via the command line.

Web Deployment (Optional):

Run the Flask app by executing the following:


python app.py
Access the chatbot through a web interface at http://127.0.0.1:5000/.

How it Works
Intent Classification
The chatbot matches user input against patterns defined in the intents.json file.
If a match is found, the chatbot responds with an appropriate reply.
Response Generation
The responses are generated based on intent matching.
It can be expanded to use machine learning models like TensorFlow for more dynamic responses.
